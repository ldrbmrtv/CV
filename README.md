## Education
- 2009-2014	Specialist Student (equiv. to MD). Faculty of Philosophy, SPBU, St. Petersburg, Russia. Specialization: Logic
- 2016-2020 Ph.D. student. Faculty of Software Engineering and Computer Systems, ITMO University, St. Petersburg, Russia. Thesis: The method of data models complex evaluation for automated unsupervised machine learning

## PhD thesis
The goal of the thesis was complex automation of model selection and hyperparameter optimization for unsupervised learning algorithms based on information evaluation of learning models. Results:
-	A formal model of unsupervised learning, describing learning models with set-theoretic operations, namely factorizations, compositions, and partitions. Provides a base for complex model selection and hyperparameter optimization
-	A set of information measures for unsupervised learning models evaluation, namely for dimensionality, model complexity, and label partitions, using adjustment for chance technique. Provides complex model selection and hyperparameter optimization.
-	A method of hyperparameter selection for unsupervised learning algorithms via prior information criteria, based on objective prior distributions for partitions and decision-making rules, applied to the proposed information measures. The method exceeds random hyperparameter selection or using constant hyperparameters with equal time complexity
